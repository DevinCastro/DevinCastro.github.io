I wanted to keep my home page looking simple and clean, however I have a tacky looking bootstrap jumbotron code commented out just to demostrate that method and look back on later!

I used a bootstrap navbar it is mobile responsive along the background image and the text that gets smaller at a certain size.

>The code for portfolio.html and portfolio.css demonstrate my knoweledge of how to use the bootstrap grid system and bootstrap layouts.  I used cards to organize the future projects I work on.  (Obviously I dont have any work yet so these are fake and the links don't lead anywhere.  However I did put a link in the first card that takes you to a repository for this site.)
