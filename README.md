# DevinCastro.github.io

## This is my professional portfolio
### _for now_...

Deployed application: https://devincastro.github.io/

>This code is made up of 4 pages that consist of my:
>* Home page (CLICK ON "DEVIN CASTR" IN THE NAV BAR TO GO BACK TO THE HOME PAGE)
>* About me
>* Porfolio
>* Contact

I wanted to keep my home page looking simple and clean.  From there you are either able to navigate the portfolio throught the nav bar or go straight to my portfolio with the button in the center.

I used a bootstrap navbar. It is mobile responsive along with the text that gets smaller at a certain size.

>The code for the about me, portfolio, and contact page demonstrate my knoweledge of how to use the bootstrap grid system and bootstrap layouts.  I used cards to organize the future projects I work on.  (Obviously I dont have any work yet so these are fake and the links don't lead anywhere.  However I did put a link in the first card that takes you to a repository for this site.) I also made great use of rows and columns on the about me, portfolio, and contact pages.

**Important Note:**  I figured out how to add a personal LinkedIn badge on my contact page that is fully functional.  I had to add their script tag and copy and paste their code for the badge itself!

Everything is responsive on all pages, and everything works and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
